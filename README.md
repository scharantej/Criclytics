## Flask Application Design for Cricket Analysis Website

### HTML Files
1. **index.html**:
   - **Use:** This is the landing page of the website.
   - **Content:**
     - Displays a heading "Cricket Analysis" and a brief introduction to the website.
     - Provides a button to navigate to the "Analysis" page.
2. **analysis.html**:
   - **Use:** This page displays the cricket analysis data and visualizations.
   - **Content:**
     - Includes a navigation bar with links to different types of cricket analyses (e.g., batting, bowling, fielding).
     - Contains data tables, graphs, and charts to visualize the analysis results.

### Routes
1. **homepage()**:
   - **Purpose:** Renders the "index.html" page, serving as the website's home page.
   - **Functionality:**
     - @app.route('/') decorator defines the route for the home page.
     - The function returns the rendered "index.html" template using render_template().
2. **analysis()**:
   - **Purpose:** Renders the "analysis.html" page, showing the cricket analysis data.
   - **Functionality:**
     - @app.route('/analysis') decorator specifies the route for the analysis page.
     - The function fetches the necessary cricket data from a database or API.
     - It then renders the "analysis.html" template with the retrieved data as context.

### Additional Considerations
- The design can be expanded to include more features, such as player profiles, team standings, and match schedules.
- The HTML templates can be enhanced with CSS styling to improve the visual appeal of the website.
- The Flask application can be integrated with external APIs or databases to fetch real-time cricket data.
